# Feature Specification: Multi-Source ETL Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me extracts, transforms, loads data from and to sources or sinks like kafka, postgres, mysql, and amazon S3. All code should be unit tested and integration tested. Any test data should be mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real sources."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data engineer, I need to extract data from multiple source systems (Kafka, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, Amazon S3), apply transformations to standardize and enrich the data, and load the
results into target systems, so that data can flow reliably between systems for analytics
and operational use cases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a source configuration for PostgreSQL with connection details and a query,
   **When** the extract operation runs, **Then** data is retrieved and made available for
   transformation without connecting to real databases (using mocked data)

2. **Given** extracted data in Avro format, **When** a transformation is applied (e.g.,
   field mapping, filtering, aggregation, join, or windowing), **Then** the output data
   matches the expected transformed schema and content

3. **Given** transformed data and a target sink configuration (Kafka topic, S3 bucket,
   database table), **When** the load operation executes, **Then** data is successfully
   written to the target system (verified through mocked interactions)

4. **Given** multiple ETL pipelines configured to run, **When** the application executes,
   **Then** all pipelines complete with success/failure status reported for each

5. **Given** an ETL pipeline with invalid source configuration, **When** execution is
   attempted, **Then** the system reports a clear error message and does not proceed with
   processing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when source data contains null values or unexpected data types?
- How does the system handle connection failures or timeouts (simulated in tests)?
- What happens when transformation logic encounters data that doesn't match expected schema?
- How does the system handle partial failures (some records succeed, others fail)?
- What happens when target sink is unavailable or rejects data?
- How are duplicate records handled during loading?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Data Extraction**
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract data from Kafka topics
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract data from PostgreSQL databases
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract data from MySQL databases

- **FR-005**: System MUST support configurable extraction parameters (queries, topics,
  file paths, filters) defined in YAML configuration files
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle extraction errors gracefully with detailed error logging

**Data Transformation**

- **FR-009**: System MUST support filtering records based on conditions
- **FR-010**: System MUST support data type conversions

**Pipeline Orchestration**
- **FR-021**: System MUST support defining ETL pipelines that chain extract, transform,
  and load operations

  large file processing) and micro-batch processing (using Spark Streaming for near
  real-time data)
- **FR-023**: System MUST report pipeline execution status (success, failure, partial
  success)
- **FR-024**: System MUST log execution metadata (start time, end time, records processed,
  errors encountered)

**Testing & Quality**

  pipelines

  3 retries with 5-second delay between attempts for Spark tasks)

  connections using a vault solution that can be tested locally with Docker Compose
